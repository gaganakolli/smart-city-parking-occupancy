## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can determine whether a parking spot is occupied or empty based on images. This can be useful for smart city applications where real-time parking occupancy data is needed.

## Usage
1. **Load and preprocess the dataset**: Follow the steps in `parking_occupancy.ipynb` to load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Train the model**: Train the model using the provided code in `parking_occupancy.ipynb`.
3. **Evaluate the model**: Evaluate the model using the test set.
4. **Make predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Files
- `parking_occupancy.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, model training, and predictions.
- `parking_occupancy_model.h5`: Trained model file.
- `README.md`: Project description and setup instructions.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing a small sample dataset for testing (optional).

## Notes
- Make sure you do not include any sensitive data or credentials in your repository.
- If your dataset is too large to upload to GitHub, consider using a dataset hosting service like Kaggle or Google Drive, and include instructions on how to access the dataset.
